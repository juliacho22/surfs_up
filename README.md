## Summary 
Based on the statistics shown above, the surf and ice cream shop would be a good investment because the temperature is consistantly warm  between the months of June and December. This shows that the majority of the year will remain warm and enjoyable attracting tourists year round to surf and purchase ice cream.

Furthermore, one can look at the precipitation during those months to determine the investment as well. When looking at the rainfall, although on average there is little rain (0.14 inches for June and 0.22 inches for December), there are still days where there are higher amounts of rain; June has a maximum of 4.43 inches and December  has a maximum of 6.42 inches. Since the average is lower, it is still recommended to open the shop, but the owner should keep an eye on the weather for bad weather closure dates. \
